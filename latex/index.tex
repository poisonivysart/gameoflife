The purpose of the project was to build a cellular automaton defined by the English mathematician John Conway in 1970. The Game of Life contains a universe inside where cells become alive and die. Of course, there are some rules to it. And there were some steps to follow during the building of the application, which will be discussed now. P.\+S Some steps were combined and merged and modified depending on the circumstances and will be mentioned in the following pages. \hypertarget{index_Rules}{}\doxysection{Rules}\label{index_Rules}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A dead cell at time t becomes alive at time t + 1 if and only if it has exactly
\item 3 living cells in its vicinity.
\item A living cell at time t remains alive at time t + 1 if and only if it has exactly 2
\item 3 living cells in its vicinity, otherwise it dies.
\item All other cells dies
\item The neighborhood used is the 8-\/neighborhood\+: for a given cell, its neighbors are the 8 cells that surround it

C\+Make, C\+Unit and Github Actions were used for further improvement of the application.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item C\+Make is cross-\/platform free and open-\/source software for build automation, testing, packaging and installation of software by using a compiler-\/independent method.
\item C\+Unit helps to test the code and find the vulnerabilities
\item Github Actions helps with continuous integration, configuring, building the C\+Make, and testing the application as soon as the file is pushed to the github repository
